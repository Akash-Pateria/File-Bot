## Problem and Proposed Solution

Scenario: As a scrum team member, you are assigned a task by your scrum master to consolidate Minutes of 
Meetings (moms) from the retrospective that your team conducted yesterday for the sprint that just ended. Scrum master wants to keep 
track of moms you gather in real-time and at the same time also wants to comment on the notes posted by different team members. 
Once everyone is done posting their notes, you are asked to send the document to all the team members including the product 
owner.

Sounds easy? We don't think so!

Everytime you share a file with one of your teammates, it involves a cat and mouse game of hunting for their email ids, 
managing permissions and keeping track of the changes made to the file. Working on shared documents often leads to 
dependencies between team members as they have to manually check for comments and updates to the documents. This leads to 
delays and introduces overheads in the development lifecycle. A very simple task such as dwnloading a file from your Google 
Drive and sharing it with your colleague on a collaboration platform like Mattermost requires multiple clicks, keystrokes, 
tab and context switching; trust us, enough overhead to grab hold of that amazing productivity scores and introduce long flat 
horizontal steps in that perfect burndown chart.

### **Sharing and managing shared files is indeed difficult...**

Consider the scenario mentioned above. The typical steps involved can look something like this:

 - Take some time to loose that frowny face
 - Assuming your scrum master sent this message to you on Mattermost, go to Google Drive
 - Wish for your browser to remember the credentials for your email account
 - Create a new Google Docs file
 - Try sharing it with your team members; Oops! you need to name it first. Give a name, for example "retro-notes-s8"
 - Once you do that, it asks you to mention the email addresses of users you want to share that file with
 - After adding all the names (assuming you dont want to share the file with entire organization but just your team members), 
 notify everyone that they must have received a link via email
 - Make sure the team members have edit permissions
 - Give comment permission to the scrum master
 - Once all the team members have finished posting their moms, repeat steps 1-3 again.
 - Search and open the file
 - Export the document as a Doc file
 - Go back to Mattermost and upload this file on the team channel

Phew!! See, we told you it is not as easy as it sounds BUT...

What if you never had to leave Mattermost to **create** "retro-notes-s8.doc" on your Google Drive? What if you never had to look for 
all those email addresses because their **@Mattermost** handles was all you needed? What if you could just **add** everyone 
in your team as collaborators at the time of creating this doc right away with **edit** permissions? What if you could give **comment**
rights to your scrum master by typing just 4 words? What if you could **download** this doc on your team's channel without going anywhere? What if 
you had someone (**Alfred, the FileBot**) to do all this for you? What if you just had to _authorize_ Alfred once to perform tasks
on your behalf? What if you never had to loose that frowny face because Alfred didn't let you make one in first place?

This is exactly the solution we are proposing - **Alfred, your very own File Butler!** We have created a small [`video`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O2kYCTakZoHZc5ZsZX--Qsdbpt-AxwFo/view)
that tries to portray a similar setting using more than just plain text and shows Alfred in action.
