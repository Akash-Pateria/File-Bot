 - **Epics**: We defined our Epics right after the Design Milestone.

 - **Tasks**: The first thing we did for the Process Milestone is break down the epics into tasks. We added the tasks as notes to the Alfred Project Board. While adding the tasks, we added a rough estimate inside the paranthesis () as it was a requirement. The final effor estimation was done using the Sprint Planning meeting.
